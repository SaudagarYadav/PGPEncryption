# PGP Encryption and Decryption

**Release Note:**
1. This is a spring boot project which contain logic for file encryption and decryption using PGP.
2. All depencies are mentioned in pom.xml
3. For creating public key and private key you can use any software or even write java code for that. For this implementation I have used Kleopatra(https://www.gpg4win.org/download.html) or PGP desktop for creating this keys.
5. For simplicity and better understanding, I have not used properties file of spring and all data which is required are mention in controller or service class directly.
6. In real life project this is not good practice make sure to use properties file and remove hard coded strings.
7. Postman collection for testing - https://github.com/SaudagarYadav/PGPEncryption/blob/main/PGP-Encryption-Api.postman_collection.json
