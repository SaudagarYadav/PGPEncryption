# PGP Encryption and Decryption

**Note:**
1. This is spring boot project which contain logic for file encryption and decryption using PGP 
2. Two dependies or you can say jar are used (bcprov-jdk15on & bcpg-jdk15on) which is mentioned in pom.xml
3. For creating public key and private key you can use any software or even write java code for that. For this i have used PGP Desktop for creating this keys
4. For simplicity and better understanding, I have not used properties file of spring and all location and required is mention in controller or service class
5. In real life project this is not good practice make sure to use properties file and remove hard coded string
